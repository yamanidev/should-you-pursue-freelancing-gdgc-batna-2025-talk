Disclaimer: this is not a speech! Feel free to ask questions anytime via voice or chat.

---
## What is Freelancing?
- Just another work format/engagement
    - Full-time
    - Part-time
    - Contracting
- Trendy and hot topic, perfect to use as clickbait

---
## How I Got Started?

---
## Finding My First Client

---
## Managing my Time as a Student
- Failed at it.

---
## What Would I Change If I Were To Go Back?
- Not much.
- You can only connect the dots in retrospect, so don't stress too much about getting everything "right".

---
## Nuggets From The Journey
- In no particular order

---
## It Doesn't Matter What Field You Pick
- Almost everything is in demand
- The demand is for **qualified** people 
- Just be good.

---
## Communication Makes or Breaks You
- The hardest problems are people problems.

---
## Market Dynamics
- It's all about leverage!
    - Experience
    - Budget
    - Work conditions
- Supply & Demand

---
## Pay Attention to Limiting Beliefs!
Examples:
- Using Facebook to get clients
- Should I work with Algerian clients? Same deal the other way around
- But I hate working with X, they're the worst

---
## Pay For Your Tools!
- And if you can't, use free* alternatives
- Theft can be digital

---
## Don't Live Under a Rock, Please!

---
## So, Should You Freelance?
- Beginner?
- Intermediate?
- "Senior"? I don't know, you tell me.
